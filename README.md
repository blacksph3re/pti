# PTI - Pomodoro Timer Interactive

This is a no-bullshit, terminal-native keyboard-only pomodoro timer that suits the way I like to track my tasks and time. Which is, that in the morning I create a list of tasks and during the day I tick them off during pomodoros. I don't like to use the mouse, and I don't like to use the browser. I like to use the terminal, and also I like things written in fancy languages such as Rust.

## Installation
