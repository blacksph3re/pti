# PTI - Pomodoro Timer Interactive

This is a no-bullshit, terminal-native keyboard-only pomodoro timer that suits the way I like to track my tasks and time. Which is, that in the morning I create a list of tasks, during the day I tick them off during pomodoros and in the evening I move all tasks to the archive, contemplating on how much time I have wasted on which task. I don't like to use the mouse, and I don't like to use the browser. I like to use the terminal, and also I like things written in fancy languages such as Rust.

## Installation


```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/blacksph3re/pti.git
# If you have ~/.cargo/bin in your PATH
pti
```

If you want to have desktop notifications + a sound played on a finished pomodoro, add `--features=notifications`.
